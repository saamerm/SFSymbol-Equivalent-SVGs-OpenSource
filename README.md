# SFSymbolEquivalentSVGs-OpenSource
The SF Symbols are an amazing tool and look beautiful. In order to maintain design consistency with Android, I decided to create extremely identical open source svg files so you can use it anywhere else. 

### What does it look like?

Simply tap on the svg on GitHub and you'll be able to see a preview.
